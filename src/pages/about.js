				<p className="featured-work__description-p">Hi I am glad you found me. I first discovered my interest in programming
				and computer science in 2014 during two semesters of Java at Montclair State University.
				Since then I have never really stopped learning about programming and computers.
				I have tinkered with Python and the Raspberry Pi, learned some statistical programming with R in a data mining course,
				and even picked up a little Excel VBA at work to automate some calculations.<br/><br/>
				Recently, I have been lucky enough to take this hobby of mine and pursue it full time.
				I have chosen to focus on Web Development and am working hard toward full stack development.
				I am drawn to Web development because not only do I enjoy the front-end design, UI and UX aspect
				but I am also very technical and love solving complex problems;
				as such I look forward to diving into server-side programming as well.
				It just feels like the right mix of art and technology for me.<br/><br/>
				I am currently focused on front-end technologies which includes HTML, CSS with SASS, and of course JavaScript.
				I am not sure on which server-side language I will choose to specialize in but have a feeling I will learn
				both Node.js and PHP (check out this interesting article on the two languages
