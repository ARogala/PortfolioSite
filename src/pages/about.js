				<p className="featured-work__description-p">Hi I am glad you found me.
				I first discovered my interest in programming and computer science
				in 2014 during an academic year of Java at Montclair State University.
				Since then I never really stopped learning about programming and computers.
				I have tinkered with Python and the Raspberry Pi, learned some statistical programming
				with R in a data mining course, assembled my dual boot gaming pc,
				written a few basic Linux shell scripts, and even picked up a little
				Excel VBA at work to automate some calculations.<br/><br/>
				Recently, I have been lucky enough to take this hobby of mine and pursue it full time.
				I have chosen to focus on front-end web development and am working hard toward this goal.
				I love JavaScript and web development because there is such a great learning community,
				and with a few clicks of a button suddenly your code is a live website.
				I am drawn to this field because not only do I enjoy the front-end web design
				aspect of making a web site look just right, but I also love solving the complex problems
				involved in the technical side of front end programming.
				It just feels like the right mix of art and technology for me.
				I am currently focused on HTML, CSS with SASS, JavaScript, and the React UI library.<br/><br/>
				Eventually I would like to be a little more full-stack,
				but for now I feel it is most important to specialize my skills for those front-end jobs.
				I am not sure which server-side language I will choose to specialize in,
				but I have a feeling I will learn mostly Node.js as I see the benefit of
				JavaScript on both the server and client. Nothing against PHP, it is a great language
				and I have coded a little bit of PHP in WordPress and
				actually thought the basics were fairly intuitive.
				Anyway, check out this interesting article on the two languages PHP vs NodeJS. <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3166109/application-development/php-vs-nodejs-an-epic-battle-for-developer-mind-share.html">PHP vs NodeJS</a>
				<br/>
				Hope to work with you soon.
