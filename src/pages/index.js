				<p className="featured-work__description-p">Yank and Brit Art is a custom designed art blog site;
				just established in 2018. This site was build on top of the WordPress content management system and
				the custom theme was developed with the help of Twitter Bootstrap. I developed this custom blog to help
				my wife, Katie, showcase her talented art work for her Etsy shop. We both enjoyed the design process and
				hope you enjoy browsing through the site. More content coming soon.</p>
