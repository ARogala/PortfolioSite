				just established in 2018. This site was build on top of the WordPress content management system and
				the custom theme was developed with the help of Twitter Bootstrap. I developed this custom blog to help
				my wife, Katie, showcase her talented art work for her Etsy shop. We both enjoyed the design process and
				hope you enjoy browsing through the site. More content coming soon.</p>

				<p className="featured-work__description-p">My Favorite Places Map was built for Udacity's Front End Nano-degree program.
				Of course I went above and beyond the original specifications.
				This app features a filterable list containing some of my favorite locations.
				Each location is displayed as a marker on a map, and clicking the marker displays an
				information window about the location. Each information window contains a link the locations foursquare page,
				a link to search the location on google maps, the locations address, and a street view of the location.

				<p className="featured-work__description-p">The memory game was built for Udacity's Front End Nano-degree program.
				I made sure to go beyond the basic requirements and added a settings page to change the tiles and color theme around.
				The game was fun to build and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. I play it from time to time myself and my
				nieces love it. Hope you enjoy it as well.
