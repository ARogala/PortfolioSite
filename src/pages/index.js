				<p className="featured-work__description-p">Yank and Brit Art is a custom designed art blog site;
				just established in 2018. This site was build on top of the WordPress content management system and
				the custom theme was developed with the help of Twitter Bootstrap. I developed this custom blog to help
				my wife, Katie, showcase her talented art work for her Etsy shop. We both enjoyed the design process and
				hope you enjoy browsing through the site. More content coming soon.</p>

				<p className="featured-work__description-p">The Custom Home Page program was written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
				The idea was to have a custom home page for any internet browser on the computer.
				It was designed for desktop and laptop computers specifically. Features include:
				three search bars, personalized slide show, a custom clock with date, and popular icon links.
				Check it out and feel free to use and modify to your liking. Requires some basic knowledge to set up. Updates coming soon.

				I wrote this timer to demonstrate knowledge of the JavaScript language.
				Specifically, this timer has been coded with the modular design pattern and makes use of

				updating some of the timerâ€™s CSS.</p>
