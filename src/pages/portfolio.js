			<p className="featured-work__description-p">The Custom Home Page program was written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
			The idea was to have a custom home page for any internet browser on the computer.
			It was designed for desktop and laptop computers specifically. Features include:
			three search bars, personalized slide show, a custom clock with date, and popular icon links.
			Check it out and feel free to use and modify to your liking. Requires some basic knowledge to set up. Updates coming soon.
